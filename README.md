# DataAnalyzer
Simple GUI program to allow for data processig and manipulation. 
This was designed for a chemistry research project in order to break down collected data files.The main purpose was to simplify and speed up data processing to avoid manually having to clean files and perform calculations. 

# Requirements
The software shall read in a data file 

The software shall process that data file and extract data whenever the reaction area is an even number

An even number is defined as between 2 and 100 inclusive (i.e. {2,4,6,8,...98,99,100})

The software shall use the first reaction area that is equal to or greater then the even number

The software shall calculate ln(reaction Time)

The software shall calculate (ln(1/reaction temp))

The software shall store all data that it extracts

The software shall allow for exporting of data into a CSV file

The software shall allow for exporting based on reaction area

The software shall allow for exporting based on reaction temperature

The software shall allow for exporting based on compounds

The software shall be able to calculate standard deviation of data

The software shall calculate standard deviation based on a samples trials at a percentage

(I.e the standard deviation of the 3 trials for Compound A at 2% of a reaction) 

The software shall be able to calculate average values for data

The software shall have a user interface to facilitate data entry and export
